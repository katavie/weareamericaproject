Thank you to the Harvard Gazette for [profiling our project](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/12/alumna-and-her-lowell-students-lead-project-on-american-identity/) and the workshop we held at the Harvard Graduate School of Education in November! We hope you will check out the article. Thank you Juan Siliezar for speaking with us.
