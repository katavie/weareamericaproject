# Books

The National We Are America Project started in a classroom at Lowell High School in August 2018. Over the 2018-2019 school year we — students and one teacher — in the Seminar on American Diversity set out together to try to answer the question: _What does it mean to be American?_

In the winter and spring of 2019, our classes wrote two books: _We Are America_, and the sequel, _We Are America Too_. We filled the pages with stories of our American histories. In sharing the book, we realized that to truly answer the question, we needed to widen the conversation. And that is where the national project took form.

Here you can purchase the two books that started the project. We hope you find these stories powerful and we encourage you to listen to the whole library of stories on our website. Proceeds will fund the continued support of teachers and students participating in the We Are America Project nationally.
